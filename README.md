# Java Persistence Course
This repository contains the materials for a comprehensive Java Persistence course that I designed and delivered to a group of software developers. The course was designed to provide a solid foundation in using the Java Persistence API (JPA) to persist data in Java-based applications.

# Contents
## The repository includes the following materials:

- Detailed chapters covering the key concepts and features of JPA, including entity mapping, querying data with JPQL and the Criteria API, and advanced features such as caching and fetching strategies
- Hands-on code samples and exercises to help learners apply the concepts covered in the course and gain practical experience with Java Persistence
- Solutions to the exercises for reference

# Topics Covered
## The course covered the following topics:

- Introduction to Java Persistence and the JPA
- Mapping entity relationships with JPA: In this section of the course, learners will learn how to use JPA annotations to map entity classes to database tables and columns, and how to define relationships between entities such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. The learners will also learn about different mapping strategies such as using foreign keys and join tables, and the trade-offs between these strategies.
- Querying data with the JPA Criteria API and JPQL
- Advanced JPA features such as caching and fetching strategies
- Integrating JPA with other technologies such as Hibernate and Spring Data
