#  One-to-One relation types

There are many ways to build a One-to-One relationship.
If we talk about these methods and the situations in which they will be used. 
If one entity is always registered before another and this relationship is mandatory,
we can use the shared key approach.
We can use the foreign key approach if the relation is not required,
or if it is not created in a certain order. If we do not want null values in our Table,
we can use the join table approach. For most cases it will be appropriate to use the foreign key approach.
